# ESPHome RTSP Audio

**Status:** Early development. Buggy and unreliable.

External component to stream RTSP audio using ESPHome.

## Features

- **RTP over UDP** (`RTP/AVP`) — the classic transport. works with VLC and most media players.
- **RTP over TCP** (`RTP/AVP/TCP`, interleaved) — RTP framed on the RTSP connection. Works with FFmpeg, BirdNET-Go, Frigate, and most NVRs.
- Transport is negotiated per client at `SETUP`, so UDP and TCP clients both work with no configuration.
- Uncompressed **L16 PCM** audio — 16 kHz mono 16-bit, RTP payload type 96 (`L16/16000/1`).
- One client at a time.

## Goals

- Stream microphone audio off an ESP32 over standard RTSP
- Simple: Single stream, fixed 16 kHz / mono / 16-bit audio
- Pair cleanly with ESPHome's mic stack

## Design philosophy

- Use ESPHome built-ins over custom code whenever possible
- ESP-IDF first platform first sine this is the future of ESPHome

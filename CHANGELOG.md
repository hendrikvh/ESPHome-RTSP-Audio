## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Diagnostic sensors for Home Assistant.** Opt-in `client_connected`
  (binary_sensor), `client_ip` (text_sensor), and `bytes_sent` (sensor)
  so an HA dashboard can see in real time whether a client is pulling
  audio, who it is, and at what bitrate without watching serial logs.
  All three are opt-in via separate platform blocks and tagged
  `entity_category: diagnostic`. See
  [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md#diagnostic-sensors).
- **RTSP session inactivity timeout to better handle silent client disconnects.**
  A client that disappears without sending `TEARDOWN` (ue to crash,
  sleep, Wi-Fi drop) is now reaped after 60 s instead of blocking the
  single client slot for minutes until the OS-level TCP timeout fires.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-05-23

_First semi-stable release. Working nicely with BirdNET-Go so my wife is happy!_

### Added

- Single-viewer RTSP/1.0 server on ESP32 + ESP-IDF, exposing one
  microphone as a stream.
- **TCP and UDP RTP transports**, both supported. Transport is
  negotiated per client at `SETUP`: UDP (`RTP/AVP`) works with VLC
  and most players; TCP-interleaved (`RTP/AVP/TCP`) works with
  FFmpeg, BirdNET-Go, Frigate, and most NVRs. No YAML toggle.
- Tests covering ESP32-S2 + ESP-IDF and ESP32-S3 + ESP-IDF,
  run on every PR (S3 only) and on push to `main` (both) via GitHub
  Actions.
- Local Dockerised development workflow: `make config`,
  `make compile`, `make lint`. Only Docker required on the host.

### Fixed

- Crash on no-PSRAM boards. `tx_buffer_` is now reserved up front so
  the RTP send path no longer triggers OOM at runtime.
